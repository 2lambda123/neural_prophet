# Bifrost Project presents: NeuralProphet
## Install
After downloading the code (manually or via `git clone`), install neuralprophet as python package with
`cd bifrost`
`pip install [-e] .`

Including the optional `-e` flag will install neuralprophet in "editable" mode, meaning that instead of copying the files into your virtual environment, a symlink will be created to the files where they are.

Now in any notebook you can do:

`import neuralprophet`

Or

`from neuralprophet.neural_prophet import NeuralProphet`
